## Overview
This project focuses on preventing and preparing for traffic accidents by analyzing various driving conditions.

## The Problem
- Given different driving conditions such as the traffic, location or the time/season, it can impact the accident statistics and often increase it
- However, the city is usually not prepared to quickly respond to the increased accidents that can happen due to fluctuations in number of driver on the road or some areas where it might be very accident prone which can block roads and create additional problems for driver
- The increased response time can also affect death rates in accidents
- Here, we want to examine ways to help prevent against or prepare for such conditions

## Dataset
Data sourced from [NYC Open Data portal for Motor Vehicle Collisions](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95), including extensive details on incidents.


## Project Goals
Aim to develop a model for predicting accident likelihood based on region, time, or season to enhance public safety and city planning strategies.
