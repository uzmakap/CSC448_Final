## The Problem
- Given different driving conditions such as the traffic, location or the time/season, it can impact the accident statistics and often increase it
- However, the city is usually not prepared to quickly respond to the increased accidents that can happen due to fluctuations in number of driver on the road or some areas where it might be very accident prone which can block roads and create additional problems for driver
- The increased response time can also affect death rates in accidents
- Here, we want to examine ways to help prevent against or prepare for such conditions

## Dataset
- Data sourced from [NYC Open Data portal for Motor Vehicle Collisions](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95), including extensive details on incidents.
- This dataset is made of of 2.05M rows, 29 columns, with each row showing a motor vehicle collision
- It includes columns for data such as date/time, location, causes, vehicle types, injuries, and fatalities with large volume of data detailing incidents over extensive time periods
- Features granular details suitable for in-depth analysis and real-time updates.


## Project Goals and Accomplishments
The aim of this project is to develop a model for predicting accident likelihood based on region, time, or season to enhance public safety and city planning strategies.

We hope to accomplish this by:
- creating a trained model using the dataset
- Using the model to predict numbers of accidents likely to happen based on a given region, time or season
- Expected outcomes include improved emergency response times and strategies to reduce accidents
