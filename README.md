## The Problem
- Given different driving conditions such as the traffic, location or the time/season, it can impact the accident statistics and often increase it
- However, the city is usually not prepared to quickly respond to the increased accidents that can happen due to fluctuations in number of driver on the road or some areas where it might be very accident prone which can block roads and create additional problems for driver
